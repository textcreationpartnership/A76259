            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS little Book may be termed a Poſy of choice Flowers, gathered out of divers cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gardens: It contains a great many things uſeful and neceſſary to be known by all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, who at one time or other may ſtand in need of them, by way of Advice, as well as ſome may do it to put them in Practice. It is a Collection indeed, but ſuch a one, that of this nature ſcarcely has appeared in any one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, though large, and at great Price; and certainly never before in ſo ſmall a Compaſs. It contains, however, in Quality more by a great deal, than upon the firſt view, can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be gueſſed by its Quantity. I need not inſtance Particulars, ſeeing in the Title-Page they are briefly ſet down, and in the Table more at large, though in neither ſo exactly as you will find them in Particulars, duly placed in the Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:171129:6"/>I cannot doubt but it will be Inſtrumental in doing a great deal of Good: Firſt, In giving Men an Inſight what they ought legally to do. And ſecondly, What they ought to avoid, as not warrantable in the one kind to reſt ſecure, and in the other to keep out of Danger, ſaving themſelves thereby much Trouble and Expence. I have moſtly quoted the celebrated Books from whence it was taken, and is warranted by thoſe Men exceeding Skilful in the Laws of the Land; and for that Particular eſpecially have left Names behind them that cannot be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Alſo I have cited ſuch Statutes, Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern, as the Parliaments have been pleaſed to make for well ordering the Government, and rendring us a happy People, in the Security they give us as to Life, Liberty, Property, &amp;c. So putting all this together, I doubt not but the Reader's Expectation will be anſwered according to his deſire, in that he will find nothing omitted he can fancy material, as far as is propoſed, or herein could be contained; and then both of us have our Ends, I in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and he in Reading ſo uſeful a Work, as paſt all Peradventure will find Encouragement, and deſcend to Poſterity, which will be Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

frequent Depredations, and Strength and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence would ſeize upon what the Weaker could no ways defend againſt them, were not the Law by this means very much their Aid and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. This Office is of great Antiquity, and has all along held up a venerable Eſteem, and Good-liking among the People, who find great Advantage, and Benefit by thoſe ſo Commiſſioned, being uſually Men of Eſtates, Diſcreet, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, capable of diſcerning Truth from Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and to relieve the Injured, and reſtrain Oppreſſors, to puniſh Criminals, and Diſcharge the Innocent and Faultleſs.</p>
               <p>Juſtices of the Peace were Created, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 6. <hi>Lamb.</hi> 10.</p>

               <p>In ſome Caſes the Teſtimony of a Juſtice of the Peace is of as great Force, and in ſome Caſes greater than an Indictment of 12 Men upon

               <p>A Juſtice of the Peace muſt proceed by Preſcript of the Statute and Commiſſion, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Where the Statute referre to the Tryal to the Juſtice's Diſcretion, it ſeemeth he may examin upon Oath, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 20. Every Juſtice of the Peace is a proper Conſervator of Rivers within his County, <hi>Lamb.</hi> 189. And Juſtices of the Peace at Seſſions are of equal Authority, <hi>Lamb.</hi> 385, &amp;c. <hi>Vide Crompt.</hi> 122. <hi>a Nu.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>If a Felon be brought before a Juſtice of the Peace upon ſuſpicion, though it appear to the Juſtice, he be not guilty, nevertheleſs he may not be ſet at Liberty, but ſo that he may come to his Tryal, <hi>Lamb.</hi> 233. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 389. <hi>Cro.</hi> 40. <hi>b.

                  <p>☞ Note, a Supersedeas of this Nature is held good though the Sureties are not named, nor the Summ they are penally obliged in; yet it is better to expreſs them both; for in ſuch caſe if it ſhall appear the Sureties are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Reſponſible, nor bound in ſufficient Summs, better Sureties may be taken, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly all the Superſedeas iſſuing out of the Court of Chancery, King's-bench, and Common-pleas do mention the Names of the Sureties, and the Summs they are obliged in for the Delinquents forth-coming to anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

taken for the good Behaviour, a Superſedeas of good Behaviour may be granted, as for the Peace, <hi>Mutatis mutandis.</hi> Crompt. 237.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Superſedeas <hi>de capias indictamentum de Tranſgreſſione,</hi> and ſo of an Exigent may be granted by the Juſtices of Peace out of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, otherwiſe it would be Miſchievous for the Party, not only by Reaſon of his Impriſonment, but alſo that he may be outlawed before the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if ſo it were that the Juſtices of Peace might not take Sureties of him for his Appearance, and all is no more than to appear and anſwer to the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>And theſe according to <hi>Crompton</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Cromp.</hi> 234. may be granted by one Juſtice of the Peace, and with him agree the Books of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

               <p>The Tryal by Juries is very ancient in this Kingdom, and it is our Happineſs above other Nations, that a Man has ſo great a Benefit to be Tryed by his Equals: Men unprejudiced and unbyaſſed to deliberate upon Hearing the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Weighing in their Conſciences, the Merit of the Cauſe. This way in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree was not unknown to the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> as by ſome of their Books and Monuments of Antiquity appears: and we find it practiſed by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> makes Remarks in King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Laws, Page 118. and <hi>Cook</hi> 1 part <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> Folio 155. and ſince more amply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Every Day growing more and more in Eſteem, becauſe no Man's Life, unleſs it be in Parliament, which is a Supream Court and is ſuppoſed will never do any Man wrong, ſhall be touched for any Crime whatſoever, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being found Guilty on two ſeveral Tryals, for ſo may that of the Grand and Petty Jury be rightly termed, and the Judgment of twice Twelve Men at leaſt, all of his own Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> 12. or more to find the Bill againſt him, and 12 more to find him Guilty or Acquit him on the General Iſſue: All which Jurors ought to be Subſtantial, Honeſt, and Impartial Men, being Neighbours of the Party Accuſed, or ſuppoſed Place where the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>A Jury in this Caſe upon hearing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence muſt be fully ſatisfied in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the Party is guilty, and ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly pronounce him upon their Oaths, or

As for the Qualifications of ſuch as are to be upon Juries, the Law has provided that they ſhall be Perſons of Honeſty, Ability, Integrity, and Indifferency, and <hi>Coke</hi> in the firſt part of his Inſtitutes, Sect. 234.

               </head>
               <p>THough both of them, as I have ſaid, are Juries, yet there is made a ſmall diſtinction between them in the Title, as Grand and Petty Juries; The firſt is ſo called, as it ſeems, becauſe it uſually conſiſts of a greater Number than the other, as 17, 19, 21. or the like, yet they can make no Verdict, or Preſentment, unleſs Twelve of them at the leaſt agree; and then though the reſt conſent not, it is held ſufficient. And they are further ſo called, becauſe they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are of the greater quality; and likewiſe in regard of their Power, becauſe their Office is more great and general, extending to all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences throughout the whole County for which the ſerve as Jurors.</p>
               <p>The Petty Jury, commonly called the Jury of Life and Death, conſiſting of 12 Men, are all to agree in a Verdict, or the Verdict cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and is no Verdict.</p>
               <p>The Grand Jury, or Grand In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ueſt, for ſo they are often called, have Principally two things in their Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Indictments and Preſentments; Indictments are thoſe that are uſually drawn up in Form at the inſtance of the Proſecutor, or by the Order of the Courts,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:171129:39"/>
and then brought before, and delivered unto the Grand Jury, and the Witneſſes Sworn attend them, to be Examined by them upon the Oath they have taken; and according as they Credit, or Diſcredit the Evidence, or find cauſe, they Indorſe the Indictment, <hi>Billa vera,</hi> or <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> it is a true Bill, or we are ignorant; the latter concluding the Jury does not find the Matter, or there does not upon Evidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a ſufficient Ground for the Accuſation, that the Party's Life or Reputation ſhould be brought into Queſtion or Diſpute.</p>
               <p>As for a Preſentment, it is when of their own Knowledge, or upon Enquiry, the Jury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do take Knowledge of a Nuſance, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Injury of the Publick, which they think fit to have removed, or puniſhed, and of which they Inform the Court to that purpoſe, briefly in Writing without Form, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nature of ſuch Offence, or Thing, and the Perſons Name and Place, who is the Agriever, or where the Nuſance is, being a Ground and Matter whereon to Form an Indictment, the Preſentment differing from the Indictment in two Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> Its not being drawn up in due Form; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Indictment is commonly drawn up by the Order of the Court, or the Inſtance of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, as is ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Preſentment on the other Hand is always Originally the Act of the Grand Jury.</p>

               <p>And now from what has been ſaid, it appears that this Important Office is Branched twofold; The firſt is to preſerve the Innocent from the Diſgrace and Hazards, which by Malice, or any ſiniſter Means they may be brought into; for by the expreſs Words of the Statute of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>c.</hi> 3. and the 43 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. it is ſaid, That for preventing Miſchiefs done by falſe Accuſers, none ſhall be put to anſwer, unleſs it be by Indictment, or Preſentment of Good and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People of the ſame Neighbourhood, where ſuch Deeds be done, and this no doubt may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Imply a Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>The other Branch is to enquire after, and give Notices of all Nuſances, Offences, Crimes and the like, in the County for which they ſerve, that ſo Offenders may be brought to Trial if they are forth coming, or if fled from from Juſtice, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt upon the Outlawry, and ſo Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Puniſhed according to their Demerit.</p>
               <p>A Grand-jury, or Petty-jury, where there is no Witneſs againſt the Priſoner for the Crime he ſtands Indicted for, yet knowing him guilty of their own Knowledge, may find it accordingly, and this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Petty-jury appears pretty plain by the Words ſpoken to them by the Court; for if no Witneſs appears, the Court thus ſpeaks to the Jury, or to this Effect. Gentlemen of the Jury, here is <hi>L. C.</hi> ſtands Idicted of ſuch a Crime (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171129:40"/>
it) and there is no Witneſs come againſt him. So unleſs you of your own Knowledge know him Guilty, you muſt Acquit him. But where there is Evidence, the Grand-jury muſt Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Examine the Evidence for the King, and the Petty-jury muſt have the Proſecutor and his Evidence, if he have any beſide, Face to Face with the Priſoner, and patiently hear what can be Alledged in charging the one, and the others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf, and deliberately weigh the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and may pray the Court to ask ſuch proper Queſtions of the King's Evidence, and of the Priſoner, and his Evidence, as they think fit for their better Satisfaction, and ſifting out the Truth of the Matter, and to Judge of Matter of Fact according to their Evidence, as in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they ſhall believe; and where a thing is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them that they cannot well Determin, they may find it Special, and leave it to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Judges, and ſo acquit themſelves where ſuch Doubts or Scruples ſhall ariſe of falling into an Error in Points of Law, of which the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are not held proper Judges, but where it ſo requires, muſt leave it Special.</p>
               <p>And thus having ſpoken moſtly in Generals, I now come nearer to Particulars, which may brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a further Light into theſe weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that Men Warned upon a Jury, and Empa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalled, may be prepared a little to know what is Requiſit in ſo great a Charge and Truſt.</p>

               <p>The Office of Conſtable is very ancient; for no ſooner had King <hi>Alfred</hi> given the <hi>Danes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fatal Overthrows and forced them to retire to their own Country, but for the better Ordering his Kingdom, he divided it into Shires and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subdiviſion, as Tythings, Rapes, Waping-takes, Ridings, Leets, Boroughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That proper Officers being appointed in each County and Subdiviſion, the Civil Government might not only be well adminiſtred, but the People quickly gathered and brought to the Field, in order to quell any Inſurrections and Invaders; and this proved ſo effectual for the preventing of Robberies, that Hiſtorians of good Account tell us the Roads were ſo well guarded that Gold

Bracelets, Saddles, and other things of Value were faſtned to Pillars in Croſs Ways, and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one was ſo hardy as to take them thence. This King began his Reign <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 872. And ended it 898. and is held to appoint the firſt High and Petty Conſtables in <hi>England,</hi> which Offices have ever ſince continued in good Eſteem; nay, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word makes the Antiquity of Conſtables plain in Etymology. The <hi>Saxon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coning or Cyng and Staple or Stable, which ſignifies a Stay or Prop to the King, that is, to the Government, in laying Hands on Offenders, and bringing them to Juſtice; and though the High Conſtable of <hi>England's</hi> Office, uſually a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man appointed by the King, is ceaſed, yet the High Conſtables of Hundreds in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure retain and hold up the Power, as to what concerns the Civil Government; and theſe are choſen moſt uſually in each County by the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their General Quarter Seſſions, or their reſpective Diviſions; for they have Power to give them Authority, and to diſcharge them of their Office, as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>The High Conſtable is as it were Overſeer or Director of the Petty Conſtables, Headboroughs, or Tything-men, which are choſen under him, in the reſpective Towns, Villages, or Precincts within his Hundred, or ſuch Franchiſes as are under his Juriſdiction, by the conſent of the Inhabitants, or the Majority of them, and their Duty it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the High Conſtables Office in his Abſence, in keeping the Peace, and good Order in their reſpective Limits, and upon the High Conſtables Order to be aiding and aſſiſting to him ſo far as concerns his Office.

               <p>THE Power of a Conſtable in Diſorders of this Kind is very great, and it is his Buſineſs to be diligent in Suppreſſing them; as alſo that of the Sheriffs, and others the King's Officers, by reaſon ſuch Tumults are of dangerous Conſequence to the Government, and many times, as it has been known, from ſmall beginnings, broke into open Rebellions, and diſturbed the Peace of the whole Kingdom; and therefore,</p>
               <p>Note, where three or more Perſons ſhall Meet and Aſſemble themſelves together, to the intent to do any unlawful Act with Violence or Force againſt the Perſon of another, his Poſſeſſions or Goods; as to beat, kill, or otherwiſe to hurt, or without Authority to Impriſon a Man in his own Houſe, or elſewhere.

               <p>THE Office of a Churchwarden appears in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be much Antienter than in name, tho' the latter is of conderable Antiquity, the Office it ſelf being as Antient as the tolerating Chriſtian Churches in the due Exerciſe of Religion, by the Civil Power, but often interrupted and laid aſide by the Perſecutions and Turns of Government; however the Office is exceeding Neceſſary and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the Churches, and Inhabitants of the reſpective Pariſhes; for they are in the manner of a Corporation as they are taken at Common-law, properly termed Chu chwardens at the Common-law, becauſe by that Name they are enabled to take the Chattels and moveable Goods, and to implead or be impleaded, ſue or be ſued, relating to ſuch Goods and Chattels as belong, or are to the uſe and behoof of the Pariſh, of which they are ſuch Officers, and the Preſervation of the Goods of the Church are more immediately and particularly under their Care, as the Communion Plate, Books, and other Ornaments and Furniture, their Care being not to ſuffer any thing to be waſted or diminiſhed, they find, at the time of their entring on their ſaid Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the Choice or Electing theſe Officers, it is to be annually in the <hi>Eaſter,</hi> unleſs the Cuſtom in a Pariſh alter the time; and in the Book of the Conſtitution of Canons Eccleſiaſtical, in the firſt Year of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, The Churchwardens, Queſtmen, Sidemen or Aſſiſtants in the reſpective Pariſhes, are to be choſen or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by joynt Conſent of the Miniſter and Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, if ſo it may be; but upon diſagreement, the Miniſter to chooſe one, and the Pariſhioners the other, and without ſuch a Joynt or ſeveral Election, no perſon ought to take upon him the Office of a Churchwarden, nor when choſe, to continue any longer than the ſpace of one whole Year in the ſaid Office, unleſs in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner again choſen. However, there are ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that have ſet aſide this Canon, where the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in any Pariſh has been contrary to it, for in ſuch Caſes the Cuſtom has been allowed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before the Canon; And the Church, the Churchwardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being choſen are to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in obſerving that the Pariſhioners make due reſort to the Pariſh Church on the Lord's Day, and upon Holy Days, and there to continue De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly and Reverently during the Time of Divine Service, and ſuch as neglect without lawful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or urgent Occaſion for Abſence, after Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, if they further neglect, their Names muſt be preſented by the Churchwardens to the Ordinary of the place, See Canon 89, 90. 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>The Miniſter and Churchwardens are not to ſuffer any perſon to preach within the Church nor Chappel, not producing a Licenſe to authorize him ſo legally to preach, and ſuch a one as ſhall to them appear ſufficient, <hi>Can.</hi> 50. 85.

               <p>The Churchwardens, as I hinted, being in the Nature of a Corporation, have power to take Gifts for the purchaſing Furniture to the Church, or for other Advantages to the Behoof of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but they may not take an Eſtate of Land by the name of Churchwardens only; for if there be a Feoffment made to the Churchwardens of the Pariſh, the Uſe is void in it ſelf; for they are not in a Capacity to take ſuch a Purchaſe, nor may they ſubſcribe to have Lands to themſelves or their Succeſſors; for as to Lands they are no Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to Goods only.</p>
               <p>If a Bell be broke, or any ways ſpoiled, ſo that it is not Tunable, the Churchwardens by the Agreement of the Pariſhioners, or the greater part of them, may cauſe it to be new caſt, leaving it in the Founder's Hands till he is paid, and by that means the Churchwardens may bar their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of that Account.</p>
               <p>If any indifferent perſon, or other in place, buy a Bell, ſet up a Pew, or any Ornament to the Church, it cannot be taken away by him or his Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe it is a Dedication, and the

Churchwardens may ſue thoſe that attempt it; but the Action muſt be commenced for Goods for the uſe of the Pariſh, and not in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens own name; nor can any Churchwardens ſell, impair, or releaſe any of the Goods of the Church, without the free Conſent of the Sideſmen or Veſtry, under pain of being brought to Account for it, by the Succeeding Churchwardens, and forced to make ſufficient Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>If the Church-windows or Walls be broke, the Trees cut down in the Churchyard, or the Graſs eaten up there, this lies in the Parſon's Care to redreſs, and not the Churchwardens, for he is Conſervator of the Body of the Church and Churchyard, as the Churchwardens are of the Moveable Goods only.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:171129:90"/>
for by preſcription he hath and enjoys it for a reaſonable Conſideration: But if there be no Care taken to repair ſuch a Pew by the party claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by preſcription, and it run to ruin; the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary may take it into his hands; yet he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in this Caſe in exempted Chappels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Noble-men.</p>
               <p>The Churchwardens beſide the looking after the Books and other Neceſſaries and Ornaments of the Church to ſee them kept in good Order, are to provide Bread and Wine for the Sacrament, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the number of the Communicants, and a pariſh Rate may be made for ſupplying this and other Neceſſaries.

               <p>The Church-wardens have no Action at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law to recover a Legacy never in their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: But for any Goods and Ornaments of the Church, being once in their Poſſeſſion or Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they may maintain an Appeal of Robbery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any one or more perſons that Steals them, and an Action of Treſpaſs againſt him that does, without Right, take them away, even againſt the Parſon or Vicar ſo offending; and the Damages ſo to be recovered againſt ſuch Offenders, ſhall be converted to the Uſe of the Pariſh.
